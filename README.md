# parley

a social media platform dedicated to intellectually discussing ideas based on logic and reason rather than emotional bias.

user content is automatically moderated by a sentiment analysis engine that must approve content before it is accepted.

the goal is to give those a place to propose, debate, and challenge ideas in a reasonable manner for the sake of finding the truth in contrast
plague of modern society that villainizes any opposing views.
