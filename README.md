# parley app

A social media platform dedicated to intellectually discussing ideas based on logic and reason rather than emotional bias.
Currently a work in progress.

## the problem
Modern public discourse (in the political arena) has become unproductive in recent history as those on the far side of either ends of the spectrum refuse acknowledge any proposotion that opposes their own. Some analyses on this have concluded that this is the result of individuals associating their ideas with themselse, thus they will not tolerate anything that challenges their ideas. Ideas are meant to be debated between opposing views with logic and sound reasoning in pursuit of a greater truth, but these modern trends go against that.

## the solution
Parley is a platform that enables users to discuss all kinds of ideas (no necessarily political) with the intention that one's ideas are meant to be challenged for the sake of being improved. Content on the platform is moderated by a sentiment analysis engine powered by [VaderSentiment](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). The moderator requires the user's posts and comments to be emotionally neutral - the content must have a neutrality rating of at least 0.95. Any less than that and the content would lean towards a positive or negative bias. This goal is to promote discourse and debate using evidence and logical reasoning.

Lex Fridman's message illustrates the spirit of the platform rather accurately:
> I am not right wing or left wing. I am a human being who listens, empathizes, learns, and thinks.
> People want to assign labels to each other so they can judge without trying to understanding a person.
> Labels lessen our capacity for empathy and free thought.
